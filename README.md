## Summary
Here are some snippetes of proprietary iOS code that I developed during my internship last summer. I have chosen to include these snippets for portfolio purposes, and the code is protected under the GPL license. I chose the code snippets that I am most proud of and a full description for each snippet is found in the comments at the top of the snippet's file.

The iOS app that I built was for job site management and time entry for construction companies and it communicated with a web app on the cloud. It used facial recognition (OpenCV library) and location data to verify that an employee attempting time entry is located on the correct job site.

### Snippet File Summaries
##### Jobs Nearby:
Increased performance and running time of an algorithm that sorts open jobs based on the distance away from the user.
##### UI Panel Elements Dictionary:
Found a simple solution for making the contents of UI elements rendered programatically dynamic to changing data.
##### Salary Time Clock:
Time clocking system for salaried employees that handles all edge cases in time recording and persists employees' clock state 
across devices without increasing back-end storage requirements.
